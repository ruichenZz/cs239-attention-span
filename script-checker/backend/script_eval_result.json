    "feedback": "The script effectively combines data-driven insights with storytelling, creating a compelling narrative for the audience. However, to enhance clarity and engagement, consider the following suggestions: \n1. **Structure and Flow:** Ensure a smoother transition between paragraphs. For instance, linking the importance of data visualization directly to storytelling could create a more cohesive narrative.\n2. **Engagement:** While the content is informative, incorporating more direct questions or calls to action could further engage the audience. For example, asking viewers to reflect on their own experiences with data could foster a connection.\n3. **Emotional Impact:** The storytelling elements are strong, but adding more personal anecdotes or relatable examples could deepen emotional resonance. Consider sharing a specific success story that illustrates the impact of data-driven decisions.\n4. **Visual Elements:** While visual presentation is mentioned, providing specific examples of visuals that could accompany each point would enhance the script's effectiveness.",
