[+0.5] Update your problem statement. 

 

[+1] Create a paper prototype. Take + upload pictures or a video of your paper prototype.
Paper prototype see the attatchments.
 

[+0.5] Summarize 1-3 takeaways from the feedback you received in class. 
1. Easy to use: Since the interface is similar to existing tools, users found it intuitive and easy to start using.
2. Clarity & Guidance: Some elements need clearer instructions or explanations (e.g., hover text, placeholders) to help users understand how different parts correlate and what each color represents.
3. Saving and versions: Users requested a save button and a way to view past versions (e.g., version1, version2, version3) for tracking changes.

 

[+1] Articulate your design goals as you start to implement a high-fidelity prototype of your interactive system.

 

(required) Design goal 1
- What is the goal?:

- Why is it important? How evidence (from your user research or related work) convinces you of its importance? Include any quotes, citations, etc. that help make your point:

- How will you design for this goal? What implementation choice will you make?:

 

(required) Design goal 2
- What is the goal?:

- Why is it important? How evidence (from your user research or related work) convinces you of its importance? Include any quotes, citations, etc. that help make your point:

- How will you design for this goal? What implementation choice will you make?:

[+1] Provide a plan for implementation. Create a timeline. Suggestion: Work backwards from the March 4 pilot deadline. 

 

What did each member contribute to this phase of the project?

 

Did you use a generative AI tool? If so, which and how?

 

How much time did you spend on this assignment

- as a group?

- individually?

 

[+1] Depth: Conduct an additional two cognitive walkthroughs with potential users (+0.5 per session)

[+1] Depth: Conduct another 2 user research sessions (+0.5 per session)

[+1] Depth: Find a model paper with a design goals section. Write up your design goals in a similar fashion. The model paper can be the same as before.
