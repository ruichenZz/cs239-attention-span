# Evaluation

### Conducting user evaluation [+5]

Your goal is to assess the usability of your system.

1. [+5] Evaluate your system with at least 10 participants. Write and submit 0.5-1p of notes for each participant.
    
    Participant 1: 
    
    Participant 2: 
    
    Participant 3: 
    
    Participant 4: 
    
    Participant 5: 
    
    Participant 6: 
    
    Participant 7: 
    
    Participant 8: 
    
    Participant 9: 
    
    Participant 10: 
    
2. [+1] DEPTH: Evaluate with 5 more participants. Feel free to make changes to your system between the first and second round of evaluation. If you do make changes, summarize the changes you made and why.

### After your evaluation [+4]

1. [+4] Analyze your data and write up your key findings. The findings should be about 0.5-1p for each motivating question and any other interesting findings.
- For any qualitative data where you cannot easily remember the details of the results, a thematic analysis is required. When you conduct a thematic analysis, include your codebook.
- For any quantitative data, submit a script for analysis + your data. Recommendation: Create a notebook for your analysis. Someone should be able to run your notebook to reproduce your results.

### Group Reflection [+1]

1. What is one thing that went well in your evaluation?
2. What is one thing that you wish you could have done differently?
3. How, if at all, did your participants represent the personas you intended to design for?
4. How do you think this impacted your results?
5. Based on the above, what does this say about the potential applicability of your system?
6. What new questions do you have based on your evaluation?
