Content Creator 1
- Primary Goal: Self-expression; wants to attract more people to enjoy figure skating.
- Content Type:
  - Vlogs about weekly training and competitions.
  - Reaction videos to trending anime or TV series related to figure skating.
  - General knowledge videos covering rules and judging.
- Video Length & Platform Strategy:
  - Initially created only long videos but later started posting both long and short videos.
  - Long-video platforms have lower commercial value, making it easier to earn money or gain opportunities on short-video platforms.
  - However, the audience overlap between platforms is small, so reposting long videos on short-video platforms doesn’t generate many views.
- Creation Process & Challenges:
  - Long videos: Difficult to edit, require extensive scripting and effort to keep engaging.
  - Short videos: Success is unpredictable; performance metrics feel random.
  - Ideal Length & Adjustments: Long videos - <10 minutes. Short videos - >15 seconds. Adapted content based on declining engagement with long videos. Also follows trends when relevant.
- Unplanned Edits & Engagement Strategies:
  - Adds memes or special effects (audio/visual) to enhance engagement.
  - Uses humor and avoids large blocks of information.
  - For technical topics, includes on-screen graphs and bullet points to improve clarity.
- Audience Attention & Observations:
  - Unclear if declining engagement is due to attention span or content quality.
  - Mid-length videos (3-6 minutes) tend to perform poorly unless they have outstanding content.
  - Instead of assuming attention spans are shrinking, creators should focus on making their content more engaging.


Content Creator 2
- Primary Goal: Initially created figure skating tutorials to promote offline classes. Did this for about five years but stopped after moving to Spain. Now focuses on lifestyle content.
- Content Type:
  - Previously: Figure skating tutorials.
  - Now: Moved to Spain, so lifestyle content—differences between living in Spain and China, sightseeing, etc.
- Video Length & Platform Strategy:
    - Posts only long videos.
    - Considered short-video platforms like Douyin but decided against them because:
      - Tutorials are too long for short-video platforms.
      - Editing for both long and short formats would be too time-consuming.
- Creation Process & Challenges:
  - Simple process: Roughly plan a script → Film → Edit → Publish.
  - No distinction in approach between long and short videos — same content is posted on both platforms.
  - Finds short-video editing more challenging since audiences are less forgiving; long-video viewers tend to be more patient, especially for tutorial content.
- Adjustments & Engagement Strategies:
  - Tutorials are generally around 15 minutes long.
  - Rarely modifies content based on feedback, except for incorporating requested tutorials.
  - Limited flexibility in making mid-edit adjustments since content is pre-recorded. Would consider recording additional transitions for better flow.
  - No specific engagement strategies—tutorial viewers tend to watch regardless due to the value of the content.
- Audience Attention & Observations:
  - Decline in video performance is not due to attention span but rather a shift in content focus.
  - Completion rates are lower now, likely because current content differs from previous tutorials.
- Challenges Faced:
  - Creating long tutorial videos required extensive filming and selecting usable footage, making both shooting and editing difficult.


### **Content Creator 3**

1. **Do you create only one type of video (short/long) or both?**  
   I create exclusively short videos, usually between 1 to 2 minutes.

2. **(If not both) Why not the other?**  
   I’ve tried making longer videos before, but they typically require more in-depth editing and scripting. Short videos fit my schedule and my audience’s preference better.

3. **(If both) Which one is more difficult to make? Why?**  
   *(Not applicable since I only make short videos.)*  
   However, in my brief experience with longer videos, I found them challenging because it’s harder to maintain consistent pacing and quality over a longer duration.

4. **Do you adjust content based on the feedback? Based on the data/trend?**  
   Definitely. I post polls on my social media to see what type of content viewers want next, and I keep a close eye on my analytics. If a certain topic resonates well, I’ll produce more videos around it. If something doesn’t perform, I either switch up the format or retire that concept.

5. **What strategies do you use to keep the audience engaged throughout the video? (length of video, more memes or jokes, more information)**  
   - **Length**: I keep it short and snappy—1 to 2 minutes max.  
   - **Story Hooks**: I often start with a question or a quick anecdote to pique curiosity.  
   - **Edits & Effects**: I add small text overlays, memes, and music transitions to keep energy levels high.

6. **Have you noticed any changes in your audience’s attention span (average watch time?) over time? If so, how has that influenced the way you create content?**  
   I haven’t seen a dramatic shift in average watch times. My audience seems pretty stable, but I do notice spikes when I release trendy or seasonal content. I’ve learned to time my uploads around big events or holidays to keep watch times consistent.


### **Content Creator 4**

1. **Do you create only one type of video (short/long) or both?**  
I do both. My short videos are usually around one minute long, while my long videos are typically over 10 minutes.

2. **(If not both) Why not the other?**  
*(Not applicable because I produce both.)*

3. **(If both) Which one is more difficult to make? Why?**  
I find long videos more challenging. They require a larger amount of footage—capturing various scenes to piece together—and the editing process is more complex. I need to ensure the overall story or theme remains cohesive, while also finding ways to keep the audience engaged throughout a 10-plus minute runtime.

4. **Do you adjust content based on feedback? Based on data/trend?**  
Yes, I do. I review metrics like view counts and completion rates, especially noting where viewers tend to drop off. If I see that certain types of short videos have high engagement, I’ll produce more content in that style. I also keep an eye on trending topics, such as holiday events or popular TV shows, and try to incorporate these themes into my videos.

5. **What strategies do you use to keep the audience engaged throughout the video? (length of video, more memes or jokes, more information)**  
- **Short Videos:** They need to be fast-paced with attractive music and smooth transitions.  
- **Long Videos:** I break the video into segments using chapter titles or on-screen subtitles so viewers can easily navigate to the parts they’re most interested in. I also insert humorous elements or interactive questions to enhance engagement.

6. **Have you noticed any changes in your audience’s attention span (average watch time?) over time? If so, how has that influenced the way you create content?**  
I’ve noticed that with the rise of short-video platforms, audiences now have a stronger preference for quickly accessible information. As a result, I incorporate more rapid scene changes and transition animations in my long videos to keep the pace tight. Still, my core audience is willing to watch longer content as long as it remains informative and entertaining.

- Primary Goal: Initially started as a way to document daily life but continued due to good audience engagement and growing views.
- Content Type: Dance-related content, including training, competition vlogs, and product recommendations.
- Video Length & Platform Strategy:
  - Posts the same content on both short-video and long-video platforms without major edits.
  - Video length varies naturally based on content type:
      - Product recommendations / vlogs → longer.
      - Dance clips → usually shorter.
  - Adjusts content length based on audience feedback (e.g., if viewers request vlogs in comments, new vlogs are made).
- Creation Process & Challenges:
  - Product recommendation videos → Outlines a rough script beforehand.
  - Other videos → Recorded spontaneously, edited in chronological order.
- Editing complexity:
  - Long videos → More footage to process, sometimes include additional unplanned details that need to be put together.
  - Short videos → Simpler edits, with less concern about restructuring.
- Ideal Length & Adjustments:
  - Dance videos → Under 1 minute.
  - Vlogs → Around 5 minutes.
  - Product recommendation videos → Under 10 minutes.
  - Observed that shorter videos perform better, leading to a shift toward shorter content. Noticed decreasing watch time for long vlogs over time, which influenced adjustments in video length.
- Unplanned Edits & Engagement Strategies:
  - Successful content elements:
    - Using popular songs or trending elements to attract viewers.
    - Following viewer feedback from comments when deciding what to create next.
    - In longer videos, adding humor and storytelling elements to increase emotional connection.
  - Audience Attention & Observations:
    - Feels that fewer people finish long vlogs now compared to before.
    - Adapts based on intuition and gradual observation of audience preferences rather than formal guidelines.
    - Believes content quality matters most—a well-liked topic or a highly engaging presentation keeps viewers interested.
- Challenges Faced: Initially worried about competition in the dance video space and how views compared to others. Over time, learned to focus on the supportive audience rather than stressing about numbers, which ironically helped improve engagement.



Summary:
Short videos are only partially responsible for the decline in attention spans. 
While shorter content may let audiences to expect faster-paced engagement, the success of a video ultimately depends on its ability to capture interest. 
Poorly structured or unengaging content—regardless of length—fails to retain viewers.

Content creators mentioned that adding humor, visual elements, and structured information presentation improves retention.
Comparing long and short videos, short videos often feel more unpredictable in performance, requiring data-driven content adaptation.
There could be tools for content creators to improve content quality, so that audience engagement is maintained in different platform dynamics.
