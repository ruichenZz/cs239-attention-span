Content Creator 1
- Primary Goal: Self-expression; wants to attract more people to enjoy figure skating.
- Content Type:
  - Vlogs about weekly training and competitions.
  - Reaction videos to trending anime or TV series related to figure skating.
  - General knowledge videos covering rules and judging.
- Video Length & Platform Strategy:
  - Initially created only long videos but later started posting both long and short videos.
  - Long-video platforms have lower commercial value, making it easier to earn money or gain opportunities on short-video platforms.
  - However, the audience overlap between platforms is small, so reposting long videos on short-video platforms doesn’t generate many views.
- Creation Process & Challenges:
  - Long videos: Difficult to edit, require extensive scripting and effort to keep engaging.
  - Short videos: Success is unpredictable; performance metrics feel random.
  - Ideal Length & Adjustments: Long videos - <10 minutes. Short videos - >15 seconds. Adapted content based on declining engagement with long videos. Also follows trends when relevant.
- Unplanned Edits & Engagement Strategies:
  - Adds memes or special effects (audio/visual) to enhance engagement.
  - Uses humor and avoids large blocks of information.
  - For technical topics, includes on-screen graphs and bullet points to improve clarity.
- Audience Attention & Observations:
  - Unclear if declining engagement is due to attention span or content quality.
  - Mid-length videos (3-6 minutes) tend to perform poorly unless they have outstanding content.
  - Instead of assuming attention spans are shrinking, creators should focus on making their content more engaging.


Content Creator 2
- Primary Goal: Initially created figure skating tutorials to promote offline classes. Did this for about five years but stopped after moving to Spain. Now focuses on lifestyle content.
- Content Type:
  - Previously: Figure skating tutorials.
  - Now: Moved to Spain, so lifestyle content—differences between living in Spain and China, sightseeing, etc.
- Video Length & Platform Strategy:
    - Posts only long videos.
    - Considered short-video platforms like Douyin but decided against them because:
      - Tutorials are too long for short-video platforms.
      - Editing for both long and short formats would be too time-consuming.
- Creation Process & Challenges:
  - Simple process: Roughly plan a script → Film → Edit → Publish.
  - No distinction in approach between long and short videos — same content is posted on both platforms.
  - Finds short-video editing more challenging since audiences are less forgiving; long-video viewers tend to be more patient, especially for tutorial content.
- Adjustments & Engagement Strategies:
  - Tutorials are generally around 15 minutes long.
  - Rarely modifies content based on feedback, except for incorporating requested tutorials.
  - Limited flexibility in making mid-edit adjustments since content is pre-recorded. Would consider recording additional transitions for better flow.
  - No specific engagement strategies—tutorial viewers tend to watch regardless due to the value of the content.
- Audience Attention & Observations:
  - Decline in video performance is not due to attention span but rather a shift in content focus.
  - Completion rates are lower now, likely because current content differs from previous tutorials.
- Challenges Faced:
  - Creating long tutorial videos required extensive filming and selecting usable footage, making both shooting and editing difficult.



Summary:
Short videos are only partially responsible for the decline in attention spans. 
While shorter content may let audiences to expect faster-paced engagement, the success of a video ultimately depends on its ability to capture interest. 
Poorly structured or unengaging content—regardless of length—fails to retain viewers.

Content creators mentioned that adding humor, visual elements, and structured information presentation improves retention.
Comparing long and short videos, short videos often feel more unpredictable in performance, requiring data-driven content adaptation.
There could be tools for content creators to improve content quality, so that audience engagement is maintained in different platform dynamics.
