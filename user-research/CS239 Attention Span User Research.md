# CS239 Attention Span User Research

## # Before you get started with users

***As a group, discuss any assumptions you have about your users or usage contexts.
Consider aspects such as language, age, dis/ability, indoors/outdoors, alone vs. small group vs.
family vs. large social gathering, etc. Write a summary of your discussion and a clear statement
of your assumptions going into user research.***

We assume that both short video audiences and content creators have the following characteristics:

- **Language and Age:** Primarily younger users (17~35 yo), English speaking or bilingual (English/Chinese)
- **Context:** Short videos are often consumed during fragmented time slots, such as commuting or breaks, usually watched alone. Long videos are more commonly watched during longer time slots, like during lunch or dinner, possibly with friends or family.
- Users are comfortable with digital platforms and multitasking
- **Device**: Both are watched on mobile devices, but long videos might also be watched on laptops or tablets.
- Short video: <30 seconds. Long video: >30 seconds

***As a group, share any hunches you want to test or unknown/open-ended questions you
want to answer through user research. Summarize your discussion, listing out 2-3 things you
want to learn through user research.***

Open-ended questions we want to answer

- Does consuming short videos truly lead to a decrease in attention span?
- What are the real reasons audiences prefer watching short videos? Is it due to shorter attention spans, or content?

***Based on your discussion above, pick a method/s. Write 1-3 sentences justifying your
methodological choice. You can employ multiple methods or just one. Make sure your response answers: How are these methods going to help you understand the problem you are trying to address? How will each method allow you (or prevent you) from reaching users of interest?***

- **Surveys:** Targeting video audiences to understand their viewing habits, preferences, and perceptions of both short and long videos. Surveys will help us collect quantitative data, providing insights into general trends in attention span, viewing preferences, and emotional vs. informational engagement.
- **Interviews:** Conducting in-depth interviews with content creators to explore their creative processes when producing content for different video formats. Interviews allow us to gather qualitative data, offering a deeper understanding of how content creators make decisions regarding emotional resonance and information density in their work.

***Write your user research protocol.*** 

- Recruitment strategy: We deploy google form and send out in group chat to survey UCLA students. Due to time constraint, most of our responses comes from Chinese students in various WeChat groups we are in.

## # Conducting user research

Our survey reveals that the majority of respondents (80.8%) perceive decline in their attention spans, primarily in academic and task-oriented contexts such as difficulty focussing on reading, classroom engagement, and time management. While short video consumption varies from user to user (25-75% for most respondents), there is no definitive correlation between high short video usage and reported attention decline. Participants that uses short videos of various amounts all reports similar difficulties of attention decline. Interestingly, opinions are divided on whether short videos are to blame (53.8% participants attribute their attention loss to short videos, though there are still no correlation to this divided opinion to short video consumption amount). Factors that retain user attention includes Compelling Storytelling, High Quality Production, and Engaging Pace. 

On an interesting note, 30% of the users admit they have difficulty keep paying attention when completing this survey.

Understanding why user stop watching videos wand what motivates them to share content is valuable 
to content creators. The primary reason why a user quite watching a video is boring content (46.2%), 
content different from what's expected (26.9%), and slow pacing (19.2%). When it comes to content sharing, the most common reason is overwelmingly funny content (76.9%). This suggest contents that evoke strong feelings from users (especially joy) have a much higher chance of being shared. 

## # After you get started with user research

***Synthesize your user research into:***

- Personas + Scenarios (at least one persona, one scenario)
- Process map or more in-depth task analysis (at least one)

***Articulate a problem statement. A problem statement should illuminate the core of
the issue you observe. Often, there is a contrastive tension between what users want to
do and what their current tools require them to do. If you cannot articulate this yet,
describe why you think you are not able to converge yet, what promising directions to
follow up with additional user research and feedback might be, and what steps you think
you should take next.***

- Tip: Rely on your process map. What is it telling you about what users want to do
vs. have to do?
- Double check: Does your storyboard communicate/highlight this core tension?

***Storyboard of how your proposed system could address the core problem. This is
where you begin to imagine a prototype to address the core problem you identified.***

***DEPTH (optional, not required) [+1]: Map out a design space of existing tools
(production or research) for supporting similar tasks x users x domains. Your design
space should include at least five other comparable tools.***

## # Communicate what you have learned

***Draft blog post summarizing user research. Your blog post draft must include:***

- ***A description of methods and key findings***
- ***A clear problem statement describing the crux of the issue you identified through user
research.***
- ***Your storyboard***
- ***At least 1 figure that is not from your storyboard***
    
    [Blog Post]
    

***DEPTH (optional, not required) [+2]: Pick a model research paper with a formative study.
Write your user research as a formative study section. In your submission, specify your
model paper and why you chose it.***

## # Reflection

***Look back at your assumptions (in the “Before you get started with users” section).
Has your user research contradicted or challenged any of these assumptions? If so,
which ones? How?***

Most assumptions we made are not challenged. However, we did assume short videos are more popular than long videos. 
Our survey suggests that, at least from user self reporting, most people consume equally or more long videos than short videos.

***What does your user research tell you about what kinds of interactive
systems/solutions are unlikely to be useful/successful? Why not? Any hypotheses about
what features of an interactive system will be useful? Why?***

For the audience user group, creating a focus helper or a time-based usage tracker/limiting tool might not be helpful. According to our user survey, most users experience decline of attention span despite various short video usage time, so limiting short video usage might not be the key factor to solve the issue. For the conctent creator user group, a audience analysis tool that only track audience demographic or watch time may not be useful.
A useful feature for content creators would be an analysis tool that monitors why audience stop watching their content and also give feedbacks to their content.


***What questions do you have about your users? What hunches or hypotheses do
you have about promising solutions? What is one thing you can do to begin answering
these questions?***

We're curious about the real cause of declining attention span and if we are able to deliver any feasible solution to it for the audience user group.  
Since so many survey respondent claim they watch more long videos but also experiences a decline of attention span, then there might be more factors to this problem than 
we initially though. 
One promising hypothesis is that the shortened attention span is not a direct result of consuming short videos, rather it's a product of the over all shift in 
media consumption habits and recommendation feeding algorithms. To answer this question, we can conduct more qualitative study, including in-depth interviews with both
user groups, audience and content creators, to better understand their behaviors and struggles.

***Did you use a generative AI tool for any part of this assignment? If so, which one and
how?***

We've used DeepSeek at the very beginning to explore what possible survey questions to include, though afterwards we've changed the majority of them.

***How much time did you spend on this assignment as a group? Individually?***
