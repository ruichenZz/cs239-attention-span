# CS239 Attention Span User Research

## # Before you get started with users

***As a group, discuss any assumptions you have about your users or usage contexts.
Consider aspects such as language, age, dis/ability, indoors/outdoors, alone vs. small group vs.
family vs. large social gathering, etc. Write a summary of your discussion and a clear statement
of your assumptions going into user research.***

We assume that both short video audiences and content creators have the following characteristics:

- **Language and Age:** Primarily younger users (17~35 yo), English speaking or bilingual (English/Chinese)
- **Context:** Short videos are often consumed during fragmented time slots, such as commuting or breaks, usually watched alone. Long videos are more commonly watched during longer time slots, like during lunch or dinner, possibly with friends or family.
- Users are comfortable with digital platforms and multitasking
- **Device**: Both are watched on mobile devices, but long videos might also be watched on laptops or tablets.
- Short video: <30 seconds. Long video: >30 seconds

***As a group, share any hunches you want to test or unknown/open-ended questions you
want to answer through user research. Summarize your discussion, listing out 2-3 things you
want to learn through user research.***

Open-ended questions we want to answer

- Does consuming short videos truly lead to a decrease in attention span?
- What are the real reasons audiences prefer watching short videos? Is it due to shorter attention spans, or content?

***Based on your discussion above, pick a method/s. Write 1-3 sentences justifying your
methodological choice. You can employ multiple methods or just one. Make sure your response answers: How are these methods going to help you understand the problem you are trying to address? How will each method allow you (or prevent you) from reaching users of interest?***

- **Surveys:** Targeting video audiences to understand their viewing habits, preferences, and perceptions of both short and long videos. Surveys will help us collect quantitative data, providing insights into general trends in attention span, viewing preferences, and emotional vs. informational engagement.
- **Interviews:** Conducting in-depth interviews with content creators to explore their creative processes when producing content for different video formats. Interviews allow us to gather qualitative data, offering a deeper understanding of how content creators make decisions regarding emotional resonance and information density in their work.

***Write your user research protocol.*** 

- Recruitment strategy: We deploy google form and send out in group chat to survey UCLA students. Due to time constraint, most of our responses comes from Chinese students in various WeChat groups we are in.

## # Conducting user research

Our survey reveals that the majority of respondents (80.8%) perceive decline in their attention spans, primarily in academic and task-oriented contexts such as difficulty focussing on reading, classroom engagement, and time management. While short video consumption varies from user to user (25-75% for most respondents), there is no definitive correlation between high short video usage and reported attention decline. Participants that uses short videos of various amounts all reports similar difficulties of attention decline. Interestingly, opinions are divided on whether short videos are to blame (53.8% participants attribute their attention loss to short videos, though there are still no correlation to this divided opinion to short video consumption amount). Factors that retain user attention includes Compelling Storytelling, High Quality Production, and Engaging Pace. 

On an interesting note, 30% of the users admit they have difficulty keep paying attention when completing this survey.

Understanding why user stop watching videos wand what motivates them to share content is valuable 
to content creators. The primary reason why a user quite watching a video is boring content (46.2%), 
content different from what's expected (26.9%), and slow pacing (19.2%). When it comes to content sharing, the most common reason is overwelmingly funny content (76.9%). This suggest contents that evoke strong feelings from users (especially joy) have a much higher chance of being shared. 

## # After you get started with user research

***Synthesize your user research into:***

- Personas + Scenarios
* Persona 1: Lily
  * Age: 22, college junior
  * Spends 1-2 hours daily watching short videos, mostly entertainment and life-related content (makeup, trendy restaurants).
  * Sometimes struggles to maintain focus.
  * More likely to share videos that evoke emotions (e.g., humorous clips).
  * Finds high-information-density videos overwhelming unless they are on topics of personal interest.
* Scenario 1:
  * Lily starts scrolling through TikTok while taking a study break.
  * She comes across a detailed makeup tutorial video. She finds it overwhelming and skips after 20 seconds.
  * Next, she sees a video with an emotional story. She watches the full video and even shares it with friends.
 
* Persona 2: Mike
  * Age: 26, part-time YouTube and TikTok content creator.
  * Content Type: Creates both short-form videos (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) and long-form content (YouTube).
  * Wants to expand his audience in both platforms.
  * Spends a large amount of time editing videos
  * Worried - sometimes an information-packed section performs well, sometimes an emotional hook gets more traction.
* Scenario 2:
  * Mike decides to create a new video about a recent scientific breakthrough.
  * He drafts the content and faces a dilemma: focus on pure facts or frame it as a compelling story to make it more engaging?
  * When editing the video, he decided to mainly focus on facts, but also mention some stories or memes.
  * After posting the video, he found that more people comment and react to the meme section.
  * He feels uncertain — despite the slight improvement, he still lacks a clear way to measure and optimize the balance between emotion and information.


- Process map

***Articulate a problem statement. A problem statement should illuminate the core of
the issue you observe. Often, there is a contrastive tension between what users want to
do and what their current tools require them to do. If you cannot articulate this yet,
describe why you think you are not able to converge yet, what promising directions to
follow up with additional user research and feedback might be, and what steps you think
you should take next.***

- Tip: Rely on your process map. What is it telling you about what users want to do
vs. have to do?
- Double check: Does your storyboard communicate/highlight this core tension?

Content creators struggle to optimize their videos for audience retention due to the unpredictable nature of attention spans. When creating videos, they often rely on intuition when deciding how to balance emotional engagement and information density. Current tools provide basic analytics (e.g., views, retention rates) but do not offer actionable insights on how content structure influences attention. As a result, creators face difficulties in deciding whether their videos should be more factual, emotionally driven, or a mix of both. Without a systematic approach to measure and refine this balance, content optimization remains a trial-and-error process.

## Title: Short Videos, Short Attention Spans? Insights from Our User Research

### Introduction

Across social media platforms and video-sharing sites, **short-form content**—videos less than 30 seconds long—seems to dominate our feeds. Meanwhile, longer videos (>30 seconds, often several minutes or more) remain important for in-depth storytelling and detailed discussions. Our research aimed to uncover whether short-form videos are indeed shrinking our attention spans and, more importantly, how content creators can address the evolving ways audiences engage with video content.

---

### Methods

1. **Surveys**  
   We distributed an online survey to capture quantitative data about video-watching habits, perceived attention spans, and reasons users start or stop watching a video. We focused on a sample of **UCLA students** and other peers we could reach quickly (predominantly Chinese and English-speaking participants aged 17–35).

2. **Interviews (In-depth Conversations)**  
   We spoke informally with a few content creators to understand their decision-making process. While we did not conduct extensive interviews due to time constraints, these conversations shed light on how creators think about balancing **emotional engagement** and **information density**.

---

### Key Findings

1. **Perceived Attention Decline**  
   - A striking **80.8%** of respondents reported feeling that their attention spans had declined, especially in academic or task-related settings like reading, classroom engagement, and study time.  

2. **Short vs. Long Video Consumption**  
   - Respondents’ consumption of short videos ranged widely (25–75% of daily viewing). **However, we found no definitive correlation** between short-video usage and self-reported attention decline. In other words, people who watch lots of short videos or very few short videos **both** reported similar struggles with staying focused.

3. **Divided Opinions**  
   - **53.8%** of participants blamed short videos for their attention loss, but this belief did **not** neatly align with the percentage of short-video consumption. Users are clearly still split on short videos’ role in perceived attention decline.

4. **What Keeps Viewers Engaged**  
   - Three major factors surfaced for holding audience attention:
     1. **Compelling Storytelling**  
     2. **High-Quality Production**  
     3. **Engaging Pace**  

5. **Reasons for Dropping Off**  
   - Users quit watching a video primarily because it is *boring* (**46.2%**), *not what they expected* (**26.9%**), or has *slow pacing* (**19.2%**).

6. **Content Sharing Motivations**  
   - **76.9%** of participants are far more likely to share *funny* or *emotion-evoking* content. Emotional resonance is a powerful driver of virality.

7. **Creator Perspectives**  
   - Our conversations with content creators revealed a tension between focusing on *factual/educational details* vs. *emotional hooks*. While basic analytics tools can show watch time or average viewer retention, **there is limited guidance** on whether (and how) to modify content pacing, emotional arcs, or information density to keep audiences engaged.

### A Quick Look at the Data

Below is a conceptual figure illustrating the **top three reasons** users reported dropping off from a video. (Percentages based on our survey results.)

```
        |--------------------------------|
        |        Why Users Stop          |
        |--------------------------------|
Reasons  |   Boring    |   Not Expected  |  Slow Pacing  |
        |--------------------------------|
%        |    46.2%    |     26.9%       |     19.2%     |
        |--------------------------------|
```

*Figure 1. Boring content, mismatched expectations, and slow pacing lead to significant audience drop-offs.*

### Problem Statement

> **Content creators struggle to optimize their videos for audience retention due to the unpredictable nature of attention spans. While analytics tools track view counts and watch times, they do not provide actionable guidance on how to balance emotional engagement and information density. Creators often resort to trial-and-error in deciding whether to emphasize facts, emotions, or both—and lack systematic feedback on which approach works best for their audience.**

### Storyboard 

1. **Panel 1**  
   Mike, a content creator, is at his desk working on a script. He’s outlining the structure of his upcoming video, deciding which parts will be purely informational and which parts will appeal more to viewers’ emotions.  
   Mike’s computer screen shows a file named “Script Feb. 6,” with bullet points and a few icons representing scenes or key segments.

2. **Panel 2**  
   Now in the editing stage, Mike grows frustrated. He has footage of himself explaining concepts, but he’s worried viewers will get bored and click away if he doesn’t add a stronger hook.  
   We see his editing software on-screen; Mike is frowning at pacing markers. A partially rendered timeline indicates where he’s inserted an emotional anecdote, but he’s not sure it’s enough.

3. **Panel 3**  
   Mike has an idea to spice things up. He decides to integrate short, meme-like clips or a quick story snippet to engage viewers more deeply.  
   He adjusts the script based on his insights from analytics—notes in green highlight “should add …” or “emotional hook here.” The video timeline on-screen also updates to reflect these changes.

**We hope this blog post gives a clear picture of the issues surrounding short vs. long video engagement and offers a glimpse into a potential solution that better aligns with both user needs and creator goals.**

## # Reflection

***Look back at your assumptions (in the “Before you get started with users” section).
Has your user research contradicted or challenged any of these assumptions? If so,
which ones? How?***

Most assumptions we made are not challenged. However, we did assume short videos are more popular than long videos. 
Our survey suggests that, at least from user self reporting, most people consume equally or more long videos than short videos.

***What does your user research tell you about what kinds of interactive
systems/solutions are unlikely to be useful/successful? Why not? Any hypotheses about
what features of an interactive system will be useful? Why?***

For the audience user group, creating a focus helper or a time-based usage tracker/limiting tool might not be helpful. According to our user survey, most users experience decline of attention span despite various short video usage time, so limiting short video usage might not be the key factor to solve the issue. For the conctent creator user group, a audience analysis tool that only track audience demographic or watch time may not be useful.
A useful feature for content creators would be an analysis tool that monitors why audience stop watching their content and also give feedbacks to their content.


***What questions do you have about your users? What hunches or hypotheses do
you have about promising solutions? What is one thing you can do to begin answering
these questions?***

We're curious about the real cause of declining attention span and if we are able to deliver any feasible solution to it for the audience user group.  
Since so many survey respondent claim they watch more long videos but also experiences a decline of attention span, then there might be more factors to this problem than 
we initially though. 
One promising hypothesis is that the shortened attention span is not a direct result of consuming short videos, rather it's a product of the over all shift in 
media consumption habits and recommendation feeding algorithms. To answer this question, we can conduct more qualitative study, including in-depth interviews with both
user groups, audience and content creators, to better understand their behaviors and struggles.
