Weihan Qu's Personal Reflection:

**Visual Presentation:**  
I wish I had drawn larger figures. The small size of my visuals made it challenging for the audience to connect with and fully understand the persona and scenario I was presenting. In future crits, I2 plan to use larger, clearer figures that can be easily seen and related to from any spot in the room.

**Delivery Style:**  
I noticed that I relied too heavily on my notes, which limited my engagement with the audience. I regret not making more eye contact, as this would have helped establish a stronger connection and conveyed confidence. Moving forward, I aim to practice my delivery more thoroughly so that I can present without notes and maintain consistent eye contact throughout.

**Content and Structure:**  
While I addressed the problem we were trying to solve, I feel that both the problem statement and the resolution could have been more impactful. The problem statement needed to be more sharply defined, and the resolution should have offered a concrete, scalable solution. I recognize that a well-articulated problem coupled with a robust, actionable resolution is crucial for persuading and engaging the audience.
