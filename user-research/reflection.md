Weihan Qu's Personal Reflection:

**Visual Presentation:**  
I wish I had drawn larger figures. The small size of my visuals made it challenging for the audience to connect with and fully understand the persona and scenario I was presenting. In future crits, I2 plan to use larger, clearer figures that can be easily seen and related to from any spot in the room.

**Delivery Style:**  
I noticed that I relied too heavily on my notes, which limited my engagement with the audience. I regret not making more eye contact, as this would have helped establish a stronger connection and conveyed confidence. Moving forward, I aim to practice my delivery more thoroughly so that I can present without notes and maintain consistent eye contact throughout.

**Content and Structure:**  
While I addressed the problem we were trying to solve, I feel that both the problem statement and the resolution could have been more impactful. The problem statement needed to be more sharply defined, and the resolution should have offered a concrete, scalable solution. I recognize that a well-articulated problem coupled with a robust, actionable resolution is crucial for persuading and engaging the audience.


Zihan Jiang's personal reflection:

During the Q&A session, someone raised a question: If a tool like this exists, wouldn’t it make all videos look the same? My initial response was that our tool only provides recommendations on structure and engagement strategies, not on content itself. However, after reflecting on this question further, I briefly wondered if it could indeed lead to "same" videos. But then I realized that, much like Generative AI, this tool wouldn’t create content for users but rather act as a reflection of the creator’s own style and choices, offering suggestions without eliminating creativity. This reinforced my belief that the tool is valuable, as it provides actionable insights while preserving original thoughts.

The Q&A also made me recognize that while our presentation was clear, we need to be even more explicit when explaining our concept, especially to those unfamiliar with this space. Certain aspects that seemed intuitive to us might not be immediately clear to an outside audience, so in future presentations, I should focus on articulating our key ideas in a way that is both accessible and compelling (well, same as making a video both informative and engaging as we aim to do in this project).

Additionally, presentation from other groups highlighted an important point: some users might avoid tools that seem too complex, unfamiliar, or unreliable. This raised the challenge that we need to ensure that our tool doesn’t feel too technical for casual creators. We will ensure that our tool enhances creativity rather than creating barriers.
